## Set up Stripe production keys

* In Stripe with admin access grab the live key and secret from account -> keys
* Create application.production.yml based on application.staging.yml,it should have a production hash similar to the staging hash from the staging one. Paste the Stripe keys in here.

## Other production Rails config

* Check these all exist and contain sensible stuff
    * config/application.production.yml
    * config/database.production.yml
    * config/deploy/production.rb
    * config/environments/production.rb

## Create production & staging EC2 instance

* Log in to AWS and go to EC2
* Select Launch
    * Select instance type, probably you want t2.small, hit Next
    * Configure instance details: 2 instances, default network, any subnet, enable public IP, everything else default, hit Next
    * Add storage: Size 16GB, general SSD, everything else as default, hit Next
    * Tags: I don't use these, hit next
    * Security groups: select existing, select default, hit review and launch
    * Hit launch
    * Keypairs: choose create new

## Create production & staging RDS instance

* Log in to AWS and go to RDS
* Select Launch
    * Select instance type, probably you want t2.micro
    * General SSD 20 GB, no Multi Availability (unless you want otherwire, but it's very expensive, so is the provisioned IOPS)
    * Instance identifier: *app*-staging, username: *app*, click next
    * VPC group default, subnet default, public: probably no, VPC: choose create new. It should be a group allowing the access only from ec2 security group
    * database_name: *app*-staging,


## Getting access to the server

1. Find your created keypair
2. Move keypair file `***.pem` to ~/.ssh/ folder
3. Run `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/***.pem` so that only you can have access to the file
4. Open `~/ssh/config` and add following text to that:
```
Host app-stage
  HostName 1.1.1.1 # IP of your EC2 stage instance
  User deploy
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/***.pem # keypair file name
  ControlMaster auto
  ForwardAgent yes
  
Host app-prod
  HostName 1.1.1.1 # IP of your EC2 production instance
  User deploy
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/***.pem # keypair file name
  ControlMaster auto
  ForwardAgent yes
```

Add your public key to Git system you are using. To get public key from private key run `ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/***.pem`.
Then run from within project folder

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/***.pem
```

You should run this if you have problems with accessing git.

Then go to EC2 security groups find default ec2 group and add inbound rule for ssh and also http and https inbound for Anywhere

5. Now you can connect with command `ssh ubuntu@app-stage`

## Setting up EC2 instance from scratch

1. Connect to EC2 instance as root user using `ssh ubuntu@app-stage`
2. Install software
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm3 libgdbm-dev runit emacs libpq-dev nginx nodejs npm
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

3. Add `deploy` user
```
sudo adduser deploy
sudo passwd -l deploy
```

4. Add `deploy` user to sudoers file so it can make some capistrano commands without prompt.
```
sudo visudo
```

Add deploy user under root, then to exit vim and save - hit Ctrl+X, then Y, Enter.
```
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
deploy  ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

4.1 Switch to `deploy` user and install ruby for `deploy` user

```
sudo su - deploy

git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
rbenv install 2.5.0 # Your ruby version
rbenv global 2.5.0

echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc
gem install bundler
```

4.2 Create folder for app
```
sudo mkdir /srv/[ app name ]
sudo chown deploy /srv/[ app name ]
```


5. Copy ssh keys, so you can `ssh` under that user.

```
mkdir .ssh
sudo cp /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys ~/.ssh/
sudo chown deploy ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Now you, and capistrano, can ssh into server under `deploy` user with a `ssh deploy@1.1.1.1` command.

5.1 Run next commands:
```
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl/
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 2048
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
bundle config github.https true
echo 'cd /srv/[ app name ]/current' >> ~/.bashrc
```

6. Fill next files:
```
config/application.production.yml # Do not commit this file into git
config/database.production.yml # Do not commit this file into git
config/deploy/production.rb
```

7. Exit from server. Edit your `config/deploy/***.rb` capistrano file to disable SSL for a while.
```
set :nginx_use_ssl, false
```

Next, run several capistrano commands on your local machine from within rails project directory.
If you get `You are trying to install in deployment mode after changing
your Gemfile. Run bundle install elsewhere and add the
updated Gemfile.lock to version control.` error, just run `bundle config github.https true` as `deploy` user on remote server.

```
bundle exec cap production setup
git add .
git commit -m 'Deploy'
git push origin master
bundle exec cap production deploy
```


8. Login to the server and run these commands on server to handle SSL encryption
```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx

sudo certbot certonly --nginx -d www.your_domain.com -d api.your_domain.com -d app.your_domain.com
```


9. Exit from server. Edit your `config/deploy/***.rb` capistrano file to enable SSL back.
```
set :nginx_use_ssl, true
```

And provision server
```
bundle exec cap production setup nginx:reload
```

### Email setup

1. Set up the inbox email at help@yourdomain.com according to this instruction https://github.com/arithmetric/aws-lambda-ses-forwarder

## Create production & staging Elasticache instance
* Log in to AWS and go to Elasticache
* Click on Get Started Now
    * Redis should be Cluster Engine selected
    * name: *app*-staging,
    * Select node type, probably you want cache.t2.micro
    * VPC group create new, use a VPC that has the port selected in inbound, if none exists, add the selected port(6379 the default) to inbound rule.
    * Mark at least one subnet.

### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you're done!
